grid_shutdown(3)
==============

NAME
----
grid_shutdown - remove an endpoint from a socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <gridmq/grid.h>*

*int grid_shutdown (int 's', int 'how');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Removes an endpoint from socket 's'. 'how' parameter specifies the ID of the
endpoint to remove as returned by prior call to linkgridmq:grid_bind[3] or
linkgridmq:grid_connect[3]. _grid_shutdown()_ call will return immediately,
however, the library will try to deliver any outstanding outbound messages to
the endpoint for the time specified by _GRID_LINGER_ socket option.


RETURN VALUE
------------
If the function succeeds zero is returned. Otherwise, -1 is
returned and 'errno' is set to to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EBADF*::
The provided socket is invalid.
*EINVAL*::
The 'how' parameter doesn't correspond to an active endpoint.
*EINTR*::
Operation was interrupted by a signal. The endpoint is not fully closed yet.
Operation can be re-started by calling _grid_shutdown()_ again.
*ETERM*::
The library is terminating.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
s = grid_socket (AF_SP, GRID_PUB);
eid = grid_bind (s, "inproc://test");
grid_shutdown (s, eid);
