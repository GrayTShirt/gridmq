grid_bind(3)
==========

NAME
----
grid_bind - add a local endpoint to the socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <gridmq/grid.h>*

*int grid_bind (int 's', const char '*addr');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Adds a local endpoint to the socket 's'. The endpoint can be then used by other
applications to connect to.

The 'addr' argument consists of two parts as follows: 'transport'`://`'address'.
The 'transport' specifies the underlying transport protocol to use. The meaning
of the 'address' part is specific to the underlying transport protocol.

For the list of available transport protocols check the list on
linkgridmq:gridmq[7] manual page.

Maximum length of the 'addr' parameter is specified by _GRID_SOCKADDR_MAX_
defined in '<gridmq/grid.h>' header file.

Note that grid_bind and linkgridmq:grid_connect[3] may be called multiple times
on the same socket thus allowing the socket to communicate with multiple
heterogeneous endpoints.

RETURN VALUE
------------
If the function succeeds positive endpoint ID is returned. Endpoint ID can be
later used to remove the endpoint from the socket via linkgridmq:grid_shutdown[3]
function.

If the function fails, then -1 is returned and 'errno' is set to to one of
the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EBADF*::
The provided socket is invalid.
*EMFILE*::
Maximum number of active endpoints was reached.
*EINVAL*::
The syntax of the supplied address is invalid.
*ENAMETOOLONG*::
The supplied address is too long.
*EPROTONOSUPPORT*::
The requested transport protocol is not supported.
*EADDRNOTAVAIL*::
The requested endpoint is not local.
*ENODEV*::
Address specifies a nonexistent interface.
*EADDRINUSE*::
The requested local endpoint is already in use.
*ETERM*::
The library is terminating.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
s = grid_socket (AF_SP, GRID_PUB);
eid1 = grid_bind (s, "inproc://test");
eid2 = grid_bind (s, "tcp://127.0.0.1:5560");
