NAME
----
grid_env - gridmq environment variables


SYNOPSIS
--------
Environment variables that influence the way gridmq works


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*This functionality is experimental and a subject to change at any time*

Following environment variables are used to turn on some debugging for any
gridmq application. Please, do not try to parse output and do not
build business logic based on it.

GRID_PRINT_ERRORS::
    If set to a non-empty string gridmq will print errors to stderr. Some
    errors will be resolved by gridmq itself (e.g. if gridmq can't establish
    connection it will retry again in a moment). Some depend on the
    environment (e.g. port that is bound by another process need to be
    released). In any case gridmq will not repeat the error message until
    error is clear and appear again (e.g. connection established then broken
    again).

GRID_PRINT_STATISTICS::
    If set to a non-empty string gridmq will print some statistics to stderr.
    That's statistics is intended for debugging purposes only.

GRID_STATISTICS_SOCKET::
    The gridmq address to send statistics to. Nanomsg opens a GRID_PUB socket
    and sends statistics there. The data is sent using the ESTP protocol.


NOTES
-----

The output of both debugging facilities (GRID_PRINT_ERRORS, GRID_PRINT_STATISTICS)
is intended for reading by a human and a subject for change at any time (even
after 1.0 release).

The GRID_STATISTICS_SOCKET facility is intended to be used by system
administrators to debug network and application issues. The ESTP format is
stable. But the gridmq support of it is experimental and is subject to change
or removal until 1.0 release.

Anyway, there is *no excuse* for making application logic based on the data
described here.  And by application logic we mean any of the following:

* Load balancing
* Failover
* Routing requests
* Executing grid_connect/grid_bind

There are other ways for load-balancing and failover in gridmq. If you feel
you can't do something, consider asking on the mailing list first.
