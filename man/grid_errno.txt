grid_errno(3)
===========

NAME
----
grid_errno - retrieve the current errno


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <gridmq/grid.h>*

*int grid_errno (void);*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Returns value of 'errno' for the current thread.

On most systems, 'errno' can be accessed directly and this function is not
needed. However, on Windows, there are multiple implementations of the CRT
library (single-threaded, multi-threaded, release, debug) and each of them
has its own instance of 'errno'. Thus, if gridmq library and the application
that uses it link with different versions of the CRT library, they don't share
the same instance of 'errno'. Consequently, error codes set by gridmq cannot be
accessed by the application. To overcome this problem, application can use
_grid_errno()_ function to retrieve gridmq's value of 'errno'.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns value of 'errno' for the current thread.


ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
rc = grid_send (s, "ABC", 3, 0);
if (rc < 0)
    printf ("grid_send failed with error code %d\n", grid_errno ());
