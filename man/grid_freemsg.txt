grid_freemsg(3)
=============

NAME
----
grid_freemsg - deallocate a message


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <gridmq/grid.h>*

*int grid_freemsg (void '*msg');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Deallocates a message allocated using linkgridmq:grid_allocmsg[3] function or
received via linkgridmq:grid_recv[3] or linkgridmq:grid_recvmsg[3] function.
While linkgridmq:grid_recv[3] and linkgridmq:grid_recvmsg[3] allow to receive data
into arbitrary buffers, using library-allocated buffers can be more
efficient for large messages as it allows for using zero-copy techniques.


RETURN VALUE
------------
If the function succeeds zero is returned. Otherwise, -1 is
returned and 'errno' is set to to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
The message pointer is invalid.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
void *buf;
grid_recv (s, &buf, GRID_MSG, 0);
grid_freemsg (buf);
